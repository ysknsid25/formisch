# Formisch for SolidJS

Formisch is a schema-based, headless form library for SolidJS. It manages form state and validation. It is type-safe, fast by default and its bundle size is small due to its modular design. Try it out in our [playground](https://stackblitz.com/edit/formisch-playground-solid)!

Formisch is also available for [Preact][formisch-preact], [Qwik][formisch-qwik], [React][formisch-react], [Svelte][formisch-svelte] and [Vue][formisch-vue].

## Highlights

- Small bundle size starting at 2.5 kB
- Schema-based validation with Valibot
- Type safety with autocompletion in editor
- Open source and fully tested with 100 % coverage
- It's fast – DOM updates are fine-grained
- Minimal, readable and well thought out API
- Supports all native HTML form fields

## Example

Every form starts with the `createForm` primitive. It initializes your form's store based on the provided Valibot schema and infers its types. Next, wrap your form in the `<Form />` component. It's a thin layer around the native `<form />` element that handles form validation and submission. Then, you can access the state of a field with the `useField` primitive or the `<Field />` component to connect your inputs.

```tsx
import { createForm, Field, Form } from '@formisch/solid';
import * as v from 'valibot';

const LoginSchema = v.object({
  email: v.pipe(v.string(), v.email()),
  password: v.pipe(v.string(), v.minLength(8)),
});

export default function LoginPage() {
  const loginForm = createForm({
    schema: LoginSchema,
  });

  return (
    <Form of={loginForm} onSubmit={(output, event) => console.log(output)}>
      <Field of={loginForm} path={['email']}>
        {(field) => (
          <div>
            <input {...field.props} value={field.input} type="email" />
            {field.errors && <div>{field.errors[0]}</div>}
          </div>
        )}
      </Field>
      <Field of={loginForm} path={['password']}>
        {(field) => (
          <div>
            <input {...field.props} value={field.input} type="password" />
            {field.errors && <div>{field.errors[0]}</div>}
          </div>
        )}
      </Field>
      <button type="submit">Login</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

In addition, Formisch offers several functions (we call them "methods") that can be used to read and manipulate the form state. These include `focus`, `getErrors`, `getAllErrors`, `getInput`, `insert`, `move`, `remove`, `replace`, `reset`, `setErrors`, `setInput`, `submit`, `swap` and `validate`. These methods allow you to control the form programmatically.

## Comparison

What makes Formisch unique is its framework-agnostic core, which is fully native to the framework you are using. It works by inserting framework-specific reactivity blocks when the core package is built, giving you native performance for any UI update. A modular methods API keeps bundles starting at just ~2.5 kB by only including the methods you import, and end-to-end type safety covers deeply nested paths and field arrays with TypeScript inference that stays fast even as forms grow.

For a side-by-side look at how Formisch compares to Felte and TanStack Form, see the [comparison guide](https://formisch.dev/solid/guides/comparison/).

## Vision

My vision for Formisch is to create a framework-agnostic platform similar to [Vite](https://vite.dev/), but for forms — a shared core that lets the same mental model and codebase work natively across every modern UI framework.
